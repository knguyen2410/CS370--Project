We cannot submit the basecase notebook due to its large size, but everything is in the report. DeepFace is used for better result in classification.

For the data folder, we have two sub-directories, which is the datasets and the test. The datasets folder contains all image in the lfw datasets. Meanwhile, the test folder contains 10 images in the test case. If you want to run the notebook, you should download the lfw datasets and place it in two folder that I describe above.
